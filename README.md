#The libft is a custom C library that is created by students in the 42 school curriculum. The purpose of this library is to provide a set of essential functions that can be used in future projects throughout the curriculum.

The library contains various functions that are commonly used in C programming, including string manipulation, memory allocation, and linked list management. The library functions are implemented from scratch, without using any existing standard library functions, so it requires a solid understanding of C programming concepts to complete.

The library is divided into several modules, each containing a specific set of functions. The modules include memory management functions, string manipulation functions, character manipulation functions, math functions, and more. Additionally, the library includes some bonus functions, which are not required for the curriculum, but can be useful in future projects.

Students are expected to complete the libft project as part of the 42 curriculum, and they must pass a set of tests to ensure that the library functions work correctly. Once the project is completed and tested successfully, the library can be used in future projects throughout the curriculum.

Overall, the libft library is an important and fundamental part of the 42 curriculum, providing students with a solid foundation in C programming and essential functions that they can use in their future projects.
